      My elephant is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, 
    he has four noses and one foot, he is a freak among other elephants,
    because he uses his noses to walk and his foot to sniff around.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Everybody is freaked out by this giant guy, except me. 
    This four-nosed creature is just like a huge octopus wriggling on land,
    which is kind of lovely.
